"The coolest thing I did with Python was the text-mining assignment we had. I discovered that get Elon Musk's tweets from Twitter and run a sentiment analysis on his tweets to access his language. Although I did not get further than that in the assignment I can see how this kind of sentiment analysis done by Python can be easily included in financial models. In the recent weeks, while I was working at an Asset Management company, I was surprised to learn that Elon Musk's tweets severely affected Tesla stock prices. This sentiment analysis could be included in projection models and help financial companies determine changes in stock prices looking at the sentiment of Elon Musk's tweets, ahead of sharp changes in stock prices"
